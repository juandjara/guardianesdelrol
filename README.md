This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Setting Up Credentials

This project uses the following free services:

* [ImageKit](https://imagekit.io/)
* [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)

You will need to register an account in both of these services and create an `.env.local` file with the credentials for them.

You can see an example of the file in the `.env.example` file. You can copy this file to a `.env.local` and write your credentials there.

```
# Supabase Admin Key, to be used only by API endpoints
SUPABASE_ADMIN_KEY=

# Supabase URL and public Key, to be used by the client
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=

# ImageKit URL, to be used by the client
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGEKIT_URL=

# ImageKit Private Key, To be used only by API endpoints
IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=
```

## Setting up the Database

1. To configure the database for the first time, run the `backup.sql` file in the SQL console of your [Supabase instance](https://app.supabase.io).

2. Then, run the `10_admin_roles.sql` file in the `db` folder to create the `admin` and `superadmin` roles as that is not created in the `backup.sql` file generated by `pg_dump`.

3. Then, continue to the **Getting Started** section to run the development server and later see the **Creating the superadmin user** section to create your first `superadmin` user.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Creating the superadmin user

You can create a normal user using the app's interface but you will need to run a SQL query to assign the superadmin role to this user. Sign up and create your new user using the login page of the app and the go to your [Supabase Instance](https://app.supabase.io) to run the following SQL

```sql
UPDATE auth.users SET role = 'superadmin' where email = 'your@email.com'
```

where `your@email.com` is the email you used to sign up in the login page.

Once this role is assigned, the `superadmin` user will have access to edit the roles of every other user in the app via the settings page in the app.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
